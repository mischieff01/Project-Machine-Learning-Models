## Project Structure

### 1. **[linearRegression.ipynb](Notebook/linearRegression.ipynb)**
   - **Description:** Implements Linear Regression.  
   - **Key Features:**
     * Uses [sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) to model linear relationships. 
     * Evaluates performance using R-squared and Mean Squared Error. 
* **Use Case:** Best for regression tasks with linear relationships between variables.‚Äù

### 2. **[logisticRegression.ipynb](Notebook/logisticRegression.ipynb)**
   - **Description:** Implements Logistic Regression.  
   - **Key Features:**
     * Uses `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` for binary classification. 
     * Includes methods for model evaluation such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve. 
* **Use Case:** Ideal for classification tasks, especially binary classification (e.g., spam detection, disease prediction).

### 3. **[decisiontree.ipynb](Notebook/decisiontree.ipynb)**
   - **Description:** Implements Decision Tree Classification.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Uses `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`.
     - Demonstrates plotting of decision trees.
     - Includes methods for splitting datasets and visualizing results.
   - **Use Case:** Best suited for classification problems.

### 4. **[lasso.ipynb](Notebook/lasso.ipynb)**
   - **Description:** Demonstrates Lasso Regression.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Utilizes `sklearn.linear_model.Lasso` for regression with feature selection.
     - Evaluates model using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
   - **Use Case:** Suitable for regression tasks requiring feature regularization.

### 5. **[randomforest.ipynb](Notebook/randomforest.ipynb)**
   - **Description:** Implements Random Forest models.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Covers Random Forest Classification and Regression using `sklearn.ensemble`.
     - Works with synthetic datasets generated using `sklearn.datasets`.
   - **Use Case:** Ideal for both classification and regression problems requiring ensemble techniques.

### 6. **[ridge.ipynb](Notebook/ridge.ipynb)**
   - **Description:** Demonstrates Ridge Regression.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Uses `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge` for regression with L2 regularization.
     - Analyzes model performance with suitable metrics.
   - **Use Case:** Best for regression problems with multicollinearity.

## Comparison of Models

| Model             | Strengths                                                  | Weaknesses                                             | Best For                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**  | Simple to implement, interpretable results. |Assumes linear relationships, sensitive to outliers. | Regression tasks with linear relationships between variables. |
| **Logistic Regression**  | Provides probabilities for classification, interpretable. | Assumes linear decision boundary, struggles with large datasets.  | Binary classification tasks, e.g., predicting success/failure. |
| **Decision Tree**  | Easy to interpret and visualize, works for non-linear data. | Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.     | Classification tasks with clear decision boundaries. |
| **Lasso Regression** | Feature selection by reducing irrelevant coefficients.    | Can overshrink coefficients, removing useful features.| Regression tasks with high dimensional data. |
| **Random Forest**  | Handles overfitting better than a single tree, works well with complex data. | Slower to train and predict for large datasets.       | Both classification and regression tasks with large datasets. |
| **Ridge Regression** | Reduces multicollinearity, prevents overfitting.          | Doesn't perform feature selection like Lasso.         | Regression tasks where all features are relevant. |
